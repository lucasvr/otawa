/**
 * @defgroup events		Event Management
 * In OTAWA, an event is an internal effecy (usually from the hardware) causing
 * variable execution time. Common events include cache accesses, branch prediction,
 * variable duration instructions, etc).
 * 
 * Events are defined by:
 * * their latency (when they arise)
 * * an estimation of their occurrences (in IPET system)
 * * the pipeline unit they apply to,
 * * their type (how they relates to pipeline stages).
 * 
 * Events provides a very open and flexible system to relates the global hardware
 * effects produced by global analyses with the microarchitecture time calculation
 * algorithms.
